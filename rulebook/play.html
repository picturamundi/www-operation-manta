While one player moves units, the other player awaits their Segment and is not allowed to move any units.</p> <p>The number of MPs available to a unit is determined by its Movement Allowance, which is displayed on the unit piece (see <a href="/rulebook/#_1-1-combat-units">Combat Units intro</a>). No unit may ever exceed its printed Movement Allowance unless it moves only a single hex.</p> <p>If a player wishes to attack enemy units, they must move the attacking pieces to a position adjacent to the enemy units they wish to attack. This is done during the Movement part of a player Segment; adjacent enemy units are then attacked during Battle (see <a href="#_2-2-combat-procedure">combat procedure</a>).</p> <h5 id="_1-1-2-stacking-limits"><a href="#_1-1-2-stacking-limits" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.1.2 Stacking Limits</h5> <p>One of the basic limitations on Movement is how many units are allowed to occupy a single hex. &quot;Step Value&quot; is a metric that is used to determine such stacking limits.</p> <p>Two charts are used to calculate stacking limits:</p> <ul><li>Each unit type has a Step Value assigned to it. The Step Value of each kind of unit can be found in the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#unit-costs-and-values">Unit Costs and Values Charts</a>.</li> <li>Each type of terrain has a maximum step value allowed. The stacking limit for different zones can be found in the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#terrain-effects">Terrain Effects Charts</a>.  While the Terrain Effects Charts impose a lower limit in some cases, the default stacking limit is a Step Value of 9.</li></ul> <p>Note that Commanders and Leaders never count against stacking, and that there is no stacking limit in Sanctuaries <code>2.5</code>.</p> <p>Although units can cross through hexes without respecting their stacking limits, each unit on the game map must respect the maximum stacking limit of the destination hex. Stacking limits also apply throughout the combat portion of each player Segment.</p> <p>No substitutions or &quot;breakdown&quot; of larger units into smaller units is allowed during Movement. See example below.</p> <div class="example"></div> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>A battalion unit (which is a single game piece) cannot be broken down into three company units (three game pieces).

However, players may want to try applying die roll modifiers based on force strength, rather than on whether a force is an attacker or defender. This is because the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#combat-results">Combat Results Table</a> is blind to whether or not a force is attacking or defending. Instead, the table favors stronger forces on high die rolls and weaker forces on low die rolls (strength being a factor of conventional or guerrilla strength points). The impact of die roll modifiers on combat results could be more meaningful if the modifiers directly relate to the mechanics of the results chart:</p> <ul><li>The presence of a Leader among the stronger force would increase the die roll, which is generally an advantage for the stronger force given the Combat Results table.</li> <li>The presence of a Leader among the weaker force would decrease the die roll, which is generally an advantage for the weaker force given the Combat Results table.</li></ul> <p>If the 1991 rules are used, a stronger defending force will almost always find itself in the awkward position of being penalized for having a Leader present to aid his troops. Conversely, a weaker attacking force is also penalized for having a Leader present. The same can be said for French forces present — players may want to base French die roll modifiers on force strength as well (see <a href="#_2-6-3-french-units">French units in combat</a>).

Moreover, the exceptions to this general rule only occur when the combat strength differential is 11 strength points or more.
<br><br>
If players also wish to take this design feature of the Combat Results Table into account, one could imagine a rule like the following:</p> <ul><li>Leaders and French units increase the die roll when stacked with the stronger force in a battle; they decrease the die roll when stacked with the weaker force in a battle.</li> <li>Exception: when the combat strength differential is 11 strength points or more, no die roll modifiers are applied.
<ul><li>First, because the Combat Results Table will not always favor the appropriate force in these situations.</li> <li>Second, because the effect of a die roll modifier on combat is almost irrelevant anyway given the large differentials.</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Finally, a potential solution could also be to redesign the Combat results Chart and erase the irregularities in cells 11:10-11, 12:8-11, 13:6-7, 14:6-9, 15:6-9, and 16:6-9.</p></div> <div class="more"></div> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>One theory emerges as the reason behind the irregularities in cells 13:6-7, 14:6-9, 15:6-9, and 16:6-9 of the Combat Results Table.

roll. regardless of the number of French units

Note that although Habré represents the most skilled Commander in the war, like other Chadian leaders he received no formal military training during his lifetime — Habré's education was in political science. This is a testimony to Habré's military genius, but it also points to the inevitability of French military superiority as a general rule.</p></div> <h5 id="_2-6-4-leader-and-commander-elimination"><a href="#_2-6-4-leader-and-commander-elimination" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.6.4 Leader and Commander Elimination</h5> <p>Below are the two different scenarios for Leader and Commander elimination:</p> <ul><li>Elimination in Combat: Leaders and Commanders are eliminated if
all the units they are stacked with suffer total elimination as a result of combat.</li> <li>Elimination in Isolation: A Leader or Commander not stacked with any friendly combat
units has no combat strength, and is immediately
eliminated the instant an enemy combat unit (not
merely another leader, Commander, or Special Unit) enters its
hex for any reason.</li></ul> <p>Leaders or Commanders cannot be attacked or
eliminated while in a Sanctuary.</p> <p>Results of elimination:</p> <ul><li>An eliminated Guerrilla Leader
is immediately placed in the New Arrival
section of the Sanctuary designated for its faction.</li> <li>If a Commander is eliminated, the game
immediately ends and the rival Commander wins the war.</li></ul> <h2 id="iii-tactical-phase-wrap-up"><a href="#iii-tactical-phase-wrap-up" class="header-anchor">#</a> III.
